### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

Hi everyone!

With a background in entrepreneurship, networking, customer-service, and sales I have now found a home as a Software Developer. I believe that tech has the capability to turbo-charge and encapsulate any current passions another individual may have. The ability to bring ideas to life using code is very Disney-esque.


Here's a little bit more about myself:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating on a full-stack application that will operate as a personal marketplace that will link to my portfolio for all of my collectibles.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m directing my focus to mastering the MEAN stack
- ðŸ¤” I really want to master DevOps!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: nicovirgino@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I hoard cards, comics, vintage toys, and so many other cool things! I love collecting.
