### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

Hi everyone!

With a background in entrepreneurship, networking, customer-service, and sales I am now learning as much as I can about technology and development. I believe that tech has the capability to turbo-charge and encapsulate any current passions another individual may have. Just the ability to create tools to solve specific problem absolutely fascinates me.

Here's a little bit more abot myself:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating on a full-stack application that will operate as a personal marketplace that will link to my portfolio for all of my collectibles.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Angular and Ruby on Rails
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with software architecture
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to tie in your passions with coding!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: nicovirgino@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he, him, his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I hoard cards... Magic the Gathering, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Basketball. It's a problem.
